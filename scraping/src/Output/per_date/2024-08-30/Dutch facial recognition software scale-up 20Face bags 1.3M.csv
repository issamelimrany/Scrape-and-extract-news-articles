Dutch facial recognition software scale-up 20Face bags €1.3M,"Enschede-based 20face, a Dutch scale-up specialising in privacy-proof facial recognition software, announced that it secured €1.3M in a fresh round of funding.

The investment includes contributions from existing shareholders including Value Creation Capital and Oost NL, and new shareholder Twinning Participaties.

In a statement translated from Dutch, Matthijs Berkelaar, investment manager Tech at Oost NL, says, “Facial recognition is a technology that requires strict rules in the field of privacy protection. The 20Face technology can provide a solution within the legislation for the security of, among other things, company buildings.”

“In recent years, 20Face has grown into a leader in the field of privacy-proof facial recognition, with several customers. The fact that new investors are joining in addition to existing shareholders is good news for the company. This allows them to make a further contribution to safe access to physical locations.”

Privacy proof biometrics

Founded in 2017, 20Face is a spin-off from the University of Twente that claims to have emerged as a “pioneer” in privacy-focused facial recognition technology.

The company’s solutions are implemented across diverse sectors including business centers, secure environments, healthcare institutions, and recreational sites.

Frank ter Kuile, CCO of 20Face, says, “Our technology is extremely suitable for locations where many people need to enter quickly and in a controlled manner. We call that Safe Seamless Access.”

“Facial recognition carries the risk of violating privacy, while security should not be at the expense of the privacy of the individual. Our solution gives the user control over their own data. Safeguarding the privacy of our users and complying with European privacy legislation is of great importance to us.”

20Face recently equipped 23 FairPlay Casino locations with their facial recognition system for enhanced access control.

Facial recognition technology

20Face uses advanced AI and computer vision for facial recognition. Its system detects faces under various conditions, checks image quality for optimal recognition, and generates a unique encrypted code for user identification.

The technology includes live detection to differentiate between real faces and photos, as well as face mask detection. Privacy is ensured with encrypted codes stored securely, and users can manage their consent.

The recognition process is fast, with 20Face ranking among the top 10 globally for speed. It claims to boast a 99.85 per cent accuracy rate in the LFW benchmark and NIST compliance, granting access to 96 per cent of users while minimising wrongful admissions to less than 1 in 10,000.

Capital utilisation

20Face plans to use the funds to accelerate growth and advance its technology. The company aims to enter new markets and forge strategic partnerships, enhancing its ability to serve customers and promote wider adoption of its privacy-first facial recognition approach.

Dick Fens, CEO of 20Face, says, “We are pleased to announce this investment. It reflects the confidence of both existing shareholders and our new partner Twinning in our mission and technology. With this funding, we can further develop our technology, expand our team and strengthen our market position.”
