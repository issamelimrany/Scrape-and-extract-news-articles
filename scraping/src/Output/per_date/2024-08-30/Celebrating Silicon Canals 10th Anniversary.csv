Celebrating Silicon Canals’ 10th Anniversary,"We are celebrating Silicon Canals’ 10th anniversary! Inspired by the Amsterdam canals and the passion of the founders, Remco Janssen launched Silicon Canals in 2014 to provide essential startup news across Europe.

He mentions, “Looking back at 2014, I realised there was a lack of reliable startup news sources for insiders and outsiders. As a journalist and communications expert, this drove me to start a media platform for startups covering not only the Netherlands but also the Benelux and Europe.”

Since our inception, we’ve seen remarkable growth and change, including our pivotal shift from Dutch to English on May 24, 2016, to better engage with Amsterdam’s diverse startup community.

“To mark our 10-year journey and reaffirm our commitment to the European startup ecosystem, we are excited to introduce Silicon Canals 3.0. With a robust backend to match the growing demand of news from the European tech ecosystem, and a clean, fresh look, we’re ready for the next decade.”

To mark this milestone, we’re excited to share a compilation of our most impactful stories. Check them out below.

The first couple of years! (2014 to 2016)

Silicon Canals was launched in 2014 to track the Dutch startup ecosystem and deliver updates on the tech startup ecosystem across the Benelux region.

- A message from our partner -



In September 2014, Startup Next, a community of a large group of local volunteers in Amsterdam active in the world of startups, announced the seven selected platform-based startups that participated in its pre-accelerator programme. One of the selected startups was Veylinx, a realistic behavioural insights platform for answering critical business questions.

In February 2015, Ace & Tate secured a deal to open pop-up stores in seven de Bijenkorf locations and raised €700K in funding. The company also planned expansion into Germany, according to founder Mark de Lange.
