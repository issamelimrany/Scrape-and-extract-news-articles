What does Pearl represent?

According to Westfriese Bedrijvengroep (WBG), a pearl is a company that sees the importance of representing the region and is willing to work hard for it.

Pearls support the organisation financially, especially with their knowledge, experiences, and network. They participate in working groups dedicated to concrete projects within our themes of Sustainability, Accessibility, Digitalization, Talent and Education, Tourism, and Housing.

According to the WBG, this agreement is a big step for ROM Inwest, making it a valuable resource for entrepreneurs by providing advice, extending its network, and offering co-financing support.
