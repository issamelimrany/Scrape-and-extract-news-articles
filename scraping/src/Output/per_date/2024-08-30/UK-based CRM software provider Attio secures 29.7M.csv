UK-based CRM software provider Attio secures €29.7M,"London-based Attio, a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software provider, announced that it has raised $33M (approximately €29.78M) in funding to redefine CRM by delivering “groundbreaking”, AI-driven features.

The investment was led by existing partners Redpoint Ventures, Balderton Capital, and Point Nine, with new support from 01 Advisors.

Since launching last year, Attio claims to have grown rapidly and attracted high-growth startups as customers, aiming to capitalise on this momentum to reinvent the CRM landscape.

In March 2023, the UK-based startup raised $23.5M in a Series A round led by Redpoint Ventures. Existing investors Balderton Capital and Point Nine also participated in the round.

Aiming to build the next generation of CRM

Attio mentions in a statement that CRM is a $89B B2B software category that has remained stagnant for too long, despite its widespread impact on businesses. Attio looks to address the need for innovation, recognising that today’s CRM systems were built in an era that predates exponential data growth.

Large language models (LLMs) are transforming software by enabling machines to understand and generate human language. They excel at two key tasks: converting unstructured data (such as emails, messages, and videos) into structured data that can be used for automation and insights, and transforming structured data back into natural language for tasks like answering questions and drafting communications.

While early AI integrations have focused on the latter—improving productivity with chatbots and AI assistants—these are just the initial steps toward more advanced applications, says Attio.

“Now, with AI as the final catalyst, everything is set to change. But simply bolting LLMs onto legacy infrastructure won’t work. Nor will trying to build workarounds for outdated data models and inflexible architectures,” adds Attio.

The company was founded to reimagine CRM from the ground up, and after three years of development, its AI-era vision is built on three core pillars.

First, a modern system of record with a “powerful” AI-native data model, custom objects, and rich metadata, is designed to handle massive workloads with sub-50ms latency.

Second, a system of context that automatically ingests and interprets all structured and unstructured data, ensuring it is always relevant and useful.

Third, a system of action that enables businesses to drive their go-to-market strategies using proactive AI agents to automate tasks and processes.

Attio aims to enable CRM to understand and improve business operations over time. It will comprehend both structured and unstructured data, enabling it to eliminate manual data entry, automate complex human tasks, and serve as an intelligent partner for go-to-market strategy.

Support from “unique, visionary investors”

Attio claims it is backed by visionary investors who share its ambition to transform the CRM space.

Existing investors Alex Bard (Redpoint Ventures), Daniel Waterhouse (Balderton Capital), and Ricardo Sequerra (Point Nine) have reaffirmed their support, while Dick Costolo (01 Advisors) has joined this funding round.

Costolo’s experience as former CEO and COO of Twitter and advisor to companies like Linear, Common Room, and Airtable will provide invaluable guidance, mentions Attio, as it continues to grow.",2024-08-30,https://siliconcanals.com/crm-software-provider-attio-secures-e29-7m/
