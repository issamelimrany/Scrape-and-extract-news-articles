Diagnostics using home testing kits

Virtual access to naturopaths and doctors for consultations

Proprietary and unique product line for the needs and desires of their customers

The company serves aged between 25 and 45 with health concerns majorly related to menstrual disorders, acne, or PMS, which OB-GYN doctors superficially treat with birth control pills.

The German company’s solution empowers women to take control of their health rather than relying on very short and often undifferentiated visits to gynecologist and gives them natural treatment options where possible.
