“Together, we can now serve the leading enterprises in Denmark and their locations across Europe. We can reduce waste faster—and even save costs at the same time. This acquisition allows us to automate administrative tasks, giving us more time to assist our customers in their transition to a circular economy,” adds Jakobsen.

With this acquisition, customers can benefit from improved services, and the synergy between Seenons and Waste Group Denmark will further reduce the amount of waste that goes to incineration.

To support Seenons’ international growth strategy, the company recently completed a successful investment round.

Invest-NL, Swiss Post VC, Capital T, Shamrock Ventures, and enterprising angel investors contributed to this funding.

Seenons: Circular waste management

Founded by Joost Kamermans, Jorn Eiting van Liempt, and Martin Kayser in 2019, Seenons has built a circular waste management platform that aims to ensure that residual waste does not end up in a landfill or the ocean, or is being burned.

Currently, the company operates in 15,000 locations across Benelux with 300 partners, dealing with 100 different types of business waste.

The Dutch startup enables organisations to get in control of their waste, providing the flexibility to choose the best partners and the insights and expertise to start the journey to zero waste.

Joost Kamermans, co-founder and CEO of Seenons, says, “Denmark is a progressive country that is ready for waste management innovation. The integration of Seenons’ advanced software with Waste Group Denmark’s in-depth knowledge provides us with a robust position to assist companies throughout Denmark in transitioning to a circular economy.”

Stijn Smetsers, CCO of Seenons, adds, “By acquiring the Danish company, we can enhance our impact and serve our larger clients via the extensive Seenons network. Innovation and collaboration are fundamental to our goal of a sustainable, waste-free future, focusing on behavioral change in procurement, recycling, and reuse.”",2024-08-29,https://siliconcanals.com/seenons-acquires-waste-group-denmark/
