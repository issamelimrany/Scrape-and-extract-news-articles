“This marks a major milestone for us to serve customers in all countries of Europe on our journey to revolutionise digital auctioning and promote sustainable trade.”

An industrial auction house

According to a statement from TBAuctions, the European market for used business equipment sales surpasses €250B annually, with digital auctioning emerging as a key channel for trading these assets, driven by technological advances, digital adoption, and a growing focus on sustainability.

TBAuctions enhances transparency and efficiency in this space with its auctioning platform, leveraging a connected bidder base, automation, AI, and scalability.

Manufacturing new vehicles, farm, and construction equipment generates over a billion tons of CO2e each year. By purchasing secondhand machinery and extending the lifespan of existing equipment, companies can reduce their carbon footprint and global emissions.

Founded in 1999 in Düsseldorf, Germany, Surplex has established a presence across Continental Europe, specialising in industrial machinery for metal and woodworking. This complements TBAuctions’ focus on mobile equipment in the Nordics and Benelux regions.

TBAuctions is a multi-brand digital auction platform for B2B used goods, operating brands including Troostwijk Auctions, Klaravik, Auksjonen, PS Auction, British Medical Auctions, Vavato, and Auktionshuset dab.

TBAuctions has over 1,000 team members across the Nordics, Benelux, UK, and Continental Europe. Its platform unifies bidders across multiple storefronts, promoting sustainable trade by sourcing locally and selling globally.

Michael Werker, Managing Owner of Surplex, says, “It makes a lot of sense for Surplex to come together with TBAuctions. We share similar values, commitment to excellent customer service, and a passion to drive the circular economy.”

Recursion to merge with Exscientia,"Utah-based Recursion, a clinical-stage biotech company specialising in drug discovery, has entered into a definitive agreement to merge with Oxford-based Exscientia, a clinical-stage drug design and development company, focused on accelerating drug design and development.

Recursion has agreed to acquire Exscientia in an all-stock deal valued at $688M (approximately €629.91M), as reported by Reuters.

The merger aims to combine Recursion’s expertise in decoding biology with Exscientia’s tech-driven approach to create more effective medicines faster.

The merged entity, named Recursion, will remain headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, and will continue trading while also maintaining a presence in the UK.

Chris Gibson, PhD, co-founder & CEO of Recursion, will lead the combined company as CEO, while David Hallett, PhD, Interim CEO & Chief Scientific Officer of Exscientia, will join as Chief Scientific Officer. Two current Exscientia directors will join Recursion’s Board after the transaction is finalised.

Gibson says, “We believe the proposed combination is deeply complementary and aligned with our missions to industrialise drug discovery to deliver high-quality medicines and lower prices for consumers.”

- A message from our partner -



“Exscientia’s precision chemistry tools and capabilities, including its newly commissioned automated small molecule synthesis platform, will augment our tech-enabled biology and chemistry exploration, hit discovery and translational capabilities.”

“I am excited to continue building the best example of the next generation of biotechnology companies. It still feels like we are just getting started,” adds Gibson.

What does Exscientia offer?

Exscientia is a tech-driven drug design and development company focused on creating more effective medicines faster. By combining precision design with integrated experimentation, Exscientia uses AI, automation, and engineering to develop drugs efficiently.

Exscientia claims to be the first company to advance AI-designed small molecules into clinical trials.

The company has an internal pipeline in oncology and partnerships covering various therapeutic areas, aiming to transform drug discovery economics and bring innovative treatments to patients.

In July 2024, the UK-based company expanded its work with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to use the cloud provider’s artificial intelligence and machine learning services to power its platform for end-to-end drug discovery and automation.

Aim of the merger

David Hallett, PhD, Interim CEO and planned Chief Scientific Officer of Recursion post-closing of the deal, says, “Adding Exscientia’s best-in-class focused precision oncology internal pipeline to Recursion’s first-in-class focused pipeline spanning rare disease, precision oncology and infectious disease is highly complementary as we look to bring treatments to patients faster,”

“We look forward to bringing our teams together and integrating Recursion’s high throughput and target biology capabilities with Exscientia’s highly scalable molecular design and automated chemistry synthesis capabilities to truly accelerate the discovery of better drugs for patients.”

Once integrated, the enhanced Recursion OS platform will improve the efficiency and scale of discovering and developing higher-quality medicines. The combined company aims to complete around 10 clinical trials within the next 18 months.

The business combination will enhance therapeutic discovery collaborations with major biopharma companies like Roche-Genentech, Sanofi, Bayer, and Merck KGaA.

This could result in around $200M (approximately €183M) in milestone payments over the next two years and potentially over $20B (approximately €18.30B) in revenue before royalties from partnership programmes, with royalties ranging from mid-single-digit to double-digit percentages.
