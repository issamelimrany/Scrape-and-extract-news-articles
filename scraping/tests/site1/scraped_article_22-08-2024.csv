Finnish biotech firm NADMED raises €3.5M in Series A round,"Helsinki-based biotech company NADMED has raised €3.5 million in a Series A funding round, led by Finland’s science-based startup investor Nordic Science Investments (NSI).

The round also saw participation from previous investors Voima Ventures and University of Helsinki Funds, along with several private European investors and a grant from Business Finland.

What does NADMED offer?

According to NADMED, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADs) are essential molecules involved in energy production, cellular repair, and growth, alongside glutathiones, (a powerful antioxidant in the body).

Imbalances in NAD and glutathione levels have been linked to various age-related health conditions, including metabolic disorders, cancer, heart and brain diseases, and muscle atrophy.

Factors like poor diet, post-inflammatory states, and treatment side effects can also reduce NAD levels, which should be monitored for issues such as unexplained fatigue, muscle weakness, long-term Covid, or unexpected drug side effects.

Founded in 2022, NADMED’s testing method, developed from research at Professor Anu Suomalainen Wartiovaara’s laboratory at the University of Helsinki, is the first to efficiently measure all four NADs using fresh blood samples with mass spectrometry-level accuracy.

- A message from our partner -



The technology uses precise colorimetric quantification, requiring only a tiny blood sample, and also measures glutathione forms from the same sample.

Demand from physicians and the pharmaceutical industry for a quick and reliable test method has surged as research increasingly links NAD and glutathione levels (collectively known as REDOX-metabolites) to various diseases.

To meet the needs of research, drug development, and clinical applications, NADMED offers measuring kits for clinical laboratories and lab services.

Capital utilisation

NADMED plans to use the funds to expand its proprietary NAD measurement technology into the US and other international markets, aiming to enhance personalised treatments for various diseases.

Jari Närhi, CEO and co-founder at NADMED says, “In the coming years, metabolism will be the hottest topic in medicine and biology, especially when applied to personalised health and disease understanding. In this dawning age of metabolism, NAD will be the new DNA.”

“We are pleased and grateful for the funding from these insightful investors to spread and further develop the unique technology to measure all REDOX metabolites – something that was not possible before.”

“This investment will enable us to bring new capabilities to diagnostics, therapy monitoring, personalised medicine, and advancement of metabolic science for the benefit of mankind.”

Enhancing diagnosis and treatment

Accurate testing of NAD and glutathione can improve the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of various conditions, driving advancements in biotechnology and medical research, and enhancing global health outcomes.

NAD levels can be elevated with B3 vitamin supplementation, which has shown promise in treating conditions like Parkinson’s disease, glaucoma, and mitochondrial myopathy. However, the effects of NAD boosters vary between individuals, making testing and optimisation crucial.

In the future, NADMED’s solution could enable more precise drug administration tailored to an individual’s metabolic type.

NADMED’s extraction method measures each NAD metabolite individually, surpassing other methods. Unlike mass spectrometry, which is accurate but expensive and limited, NADMED’s validated analysis offers high throughput and lower costs.

The company claims that its kits are the only CE-marked medical devices for NAD testing. NADMED serves clients in 27 countries, including clinical labs, universities, research institutions, and pharmaceutical companies.

Support from the lead investor

NSI claims to support “promising” science-based startups in the Nordics and Baltics, particularly those with disruptive technology and innovative solutions grounded in rigorous university research.

Speaking about the investment in NADMED, Alexandra Gylfe, founding partner at NSI, says, “Investing in NADMED was a compelling choice for us, driven by the exceptional expertise of Professor Anu Suomalainen Wartiovaara, a globally recognised leader in metabolic disorders.”

“For investors, the company’s diverse target market not only provides robust risk mitigation but also presents exciting growth opportunities across multiple sectors.”

“We are eager to leverage our strong US science and biotech networks to support NADMED’s expansion into the US market, enhancing their global footprint and driving further success in the years to come.”",2024-08-22,https://siliconcanals.com/finnish-biotech-firm-nadmed-raises-e3-5m/
Mike Lynch and four others found dead,"Mike Lynch and his daughter Hannah were found dead in a cabin on the sunken Bayesian yacht.

It includes Mike Lynch, the founder of Autonomy Corporation, his 18-year-old daughter, his wife Angela Bacares, and others. The trip had been organised by Lynch for his work colleagues.

On Wednesday, divers recovered five bodies from inside the yacht, Salvatore Cocina, director of the island’s Civil Protection Agency, confirmed to NBC News.

However, one person still remains missing, as confirmed by the divers.

“The operations are long and complex,” Italy’s national fire department, whose diving teams have been participating in the search, posted on X.

TEDIRO Healthcare Robotics: Developing smartphone on wheels

TEDIRO Healthcare Robotics was founded by Anke Mayfarth and Dr. Christian Sternitzke from the company MetraLabs and the Technical University of Ilmenau.

TEDIRO develops the “smartphone on wheels” for clinical care.

The company’s primary focus is on developing software applications for therapy and diagnostics, which are utilised on their mobile robot THERY by medical staff to assist with patient mobilisation.

Their robots use camera-based motion capture to analyse patients’ movements and provide them with feedback. The company utilise proprietary AI technology as well as AI available on the market for this purpose.

The company’s first application, gait training using forearm supports, is aimed at patients after surgical interventions on the lower musculoskeletal system, such as hip or knee operations, and was developed together with physiotherapists from the Waldkliniken Eisenberg, one of the largest orthopaedic clinics in Germany.

TEDIRO aims to redefine the interaction between humans and robots, providing healthcare facilities worldwide with technology to address skilled labour shortages, improve workflows, and maintain or enhance patient mobility for as long as possible while ensuring quality care.

TEDIRO relies on MetraLabs’ platforms for robot hardware and navigation and concentrates on the development of medical applications and system integration.

The robot is currently undergoing final testing by a medical technology testing laboratory.
