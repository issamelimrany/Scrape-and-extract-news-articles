Seaya closes €300M climate-tech fund,"Madrid-based venture capital firm Seaya has closed Seaya Andromeda fund, Southern Europe’s first Article 9 climate-tech fund, at €300M. The fund’s limited partners include Iberdrola, Nortia, Santander, BNP Paribas Group, Next Tech Fund, and Bpifrance.

Carlos Fisch, partner at Seaya, says, “In addition to investors that can provide capital, there is a need for experienced investors with a proven track record who can support startups navigating the growth challenges in this space.”

“Since we started investing, we have backed 12 climate tech companies and have successfully exited three of them: Wallbox, RatedPower and Ecoalf.”

This new fund brings Seaya’s total assets under management to over €650M, making it the largest VC investor in Spain. ‘Seaya Andromeda’ intends to invest in 25 climate-focused portfolio companies before the end of 2027.

Accelerating the growth of startups

Seaya, with twelve years of climate tech experience, has launched ‘Andromeda’ to invest in companies focused on energy transition, decarbonisation, sustainable food value chains, and the circular economy.

Pablo Pedrejón and Carlos Fisch lead Andromeda as Investment Partners. The fund, adhering to SFDR’s Article 9, ensures that all investments have a positive impact on society or the environment.

- A message from our partner -



Pedrejón says, “Deep-tech climate entrepreneurs face a unique set of challenges compared to software-tech entrepreneurs. Climate-tech companies must translate research into a working product, bring it to market, and then scale it.”

“This long journey requires different kinds of support than what is typically provided to software startups. This is why there is a need for Series B and B+ investors that help climate tech startups bridge the ‘valley of death’ – the gap from initial development to deployment at scale.”

Seaya has already made its first five investments from the Andromeda fund into impact tech companies, including Recycleye, an AI-driven robot for sorting recyclable waste, and 011h, a construction firm reducing CO2 emissions by 75 per cent.

To back 25 startups by 2027

Seaya Andromeda is Southern Europe’s largest ClimateTech VC fund, managing €300M AuM and focusing on growth. It is part of Seaya, a European and Latin American VC platform with offices in Madrid, Barcelona, and Mexico City.

Seaya’s new fund will invest between €7M-40M as a first cheque and retain capital for follow-ons. It plans to make 25 investments by the end of 2027, including around five more deals this year.

Seaya, founded in 2013 by former private equity investor Beatriz González, is a female-founded venture capital firm. González’s first sustainability-focused investment was in Ecoalf, a recycled clothing line, in 2012.

Seaya Ventures has since invested in seven more sustainability startups, including Clarity.ai, Biome Makers, RatedPower, Samara, Crowdfarming, Descartes, and Wallbox, which went public on the NYSE in 2021.

Founder and Managing Partner, González, says, “From day one we were focused on impact and climate. We have a strong technological background in this space.”

“We started in 2012 backing climate tech companies and have successfully guided three of them right through to exit. We have 12 years of experience in this space and we can bring this knowledge and expertise to founders through this specialised vehicle.”

Wordsmith bags €4.6M from Index Ventures and others,"Edinburgh, Scotland-based Wordsmith, a startup specialising in AI-powered legal operations for enterprises, announced that it has secured $5M (approximately €4.6M) in a seed funding round led by Index Ventures with participation from General Catalyst, Felix, Yellow, and S16vc.

The fresh capital will enable the Scottish company to build an in-house legal experience designed for employees.

“AI is not about replacing professionals. It’s about making them better at their jobs,” explains Wordsmith CEO Ross McNairn.

“Just as the word processor didn’t replace writers, but instead made them more productive, Wordsmith is ushering in a new era of AI-assisted professional services,” adds McNairn.

What does Wordsmith solve?

Wordsmith aims to solve a critical challenge for in-house legal teams: the overwhelming volume of routine tasks that leaves lawyers struggling to keep up with business demands.

From verifying policy details to analysing contracts and managing complex financing, there is a high demand for human judgment and significant consequences for oversights.

- A message from our partner -



However, many of the outputs are repetitive and can be templated.

And here’s where the Scottish company steps in.

Wordsmith: Made for in-house legal operations

In 2023, Ross McNairn, Volodymyr Giginiak, and Robbie Falkenthal founded Wordsmith to create a legal AI workplace platform tailored to businesses.

Through its solution, the company aims to tackle a critical challenge faced by in-house legal teams, who often have to handle an overwhelming volume of routine tasks.

“Lawyers are too often viewed as a ‘necessary friction’. A risk mitigation that the business needs to accept if they want to operate like an adult. While they bring incredible value, there is little tolerance for the perception that they are slowing down the company,” says the company.

The company’s platform provides customised policies, approvals, and comprehensive oversight of responses.

The Scottish company streamlines the drafting of legal responses, analyses documents using markups, and automates contract redlining.

“Our goal is simple. To build the ultimate legal command centre for in-house lawyers, that lets them accelerate everyone around them,” says the company.

The platform also offers immediate feedback to commercial teams, tailors reviews to address privacy concerns and facilitates quick assessments of third-party documents by procurement teams.

The investor

Index Ventures is a venture capital firm that helps entrepreneurs turn bold ideas into transformative international businesses.

Since 1996, the VC claims to have partnered with exceptional entrepreneurs in Europe, the US, and Israel, who are using technology to reshape the world.

The companies they’ve started include Adyen, Deliveroo, Dropbox, Farfetch, King, Slack, and Supercell.

Hannah Seal, the partner at Index Ventures, says, “Wordsmith is at the vanguard of a fundamental shift in how professional services are delivered. It’s not about replacement but augmentation. By harnessing the power of generative AI, they’re not only transforming the legal industry, but also paving the way for a future in which AI-assisted professionals can provide better, faster, and more affordable services to their clients.”",2024-07-02,https://siliconcanals.com/scottish-startup-wordsmith-secures-4-6m/
Amsterdam’s NestEgg bags funding from STYX,"NestEgg, an Amsterdam-based fintech platform bringing fairness to the broken market of home equity release, has secured “a significant investment” from Germany’s STYX and its team Florian Fischer, David Zwilling and Erik Walkling.

NestEgg’s partnership with STYX will help the former expand its financial services across Europe, empowering elderly homeowners to achieve their financial goals more flexibly.

The partnership will also help NestEgg to improve its platform, and elevate service standards for homeowners and investors.

Helping homeowners become financially free

NestEgg offers homeowners a flexible and innovative method to access home equity, enabling them to unlock capital without selling or moving.

Through NestEgg’s platform, homeowners can sell a percentage of their home’s future value to investors, maintaining ownership and residency while receiving immediate funds.

This appeals particularly to elderly homeowners seeking to supplement retirement income or finance expenses while staying in their homes.

- A message from our partner -



Florian Fischer of STYX, mentions, “On the other side of the equation are investors, who seek to make a social impact while investing in a new and attractive asset class. The rationale behind investing in owner-occupied residential real estate is straightforward: diversification and above-average price appreciation.”

“While traditional real estate investment trusts (REITs) offer diversification, they often struggle to outperform the market due to costs like property management, refurbishment, or vacancies.”

“Yielding above-market returns is more feasible with a property occupied by its owners, as these homes are typically self-managed, well-maintained, and cared for (and do not have tenant/vacancy risk).”

“NestEgg’s platform amplifies this advantage by allowing investors to invest in and trade equity in a portfolio of such homes, which otherwise would not be on the market (as the owners want to stay in them and are not looking to sell). This provides capital protection and above-average asset appreciation, from which the company takes a small share when realised,” adds Fischer.

Brief about STYX

Founded in Mannheim, STYX supports visionary entrepreneurs transforming cities and buildings for a greener, more livable future.

Besides funding, startups in the firm’s portfolio gain access to STYX Urban Living Labs across Europe, offering market insights, testing grounds, and a dedicated customer network for early-stage success.

Speaking on the investment in NestEgg, Fischer of STYX, says, “Almost a decade after Andreessen Horowitz invested in the US home equity platform Point, we are excited to be part of NestEgg’s journey to solve the European home equity problem.”

“In the foreseeable future, we look forward to seeing home equity become a liquid and tradable asset class, potentially even traded on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. The road ahead is long, and we are thrilled to play a part in it.”",2024-07-02,https://siliconcanals.com/nestegg-raises-fresh-funding-from-styx/
