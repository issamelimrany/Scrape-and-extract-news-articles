UK proptech startup Tract raises funding to address housing problem through AI: Here’s how,"London-based Tract, a proptech startup specialised in sourcing potential building sites and acquiring planning permissions through AI, announced that it has secured undisclosed investment co-led by Ada Ventures and Concept Ventures.

The company will use the funds to develop the technology to generate surveys, reports, and other planning documentation.

The UK company plans to build one million homes in ten years.

Tract: Addressing housing problem through AI

Founded by Jamie Rumbelow and Henry Dashwood, Tract is on a mission to use technology to address the housing problem and create a positive societal impact.

“We believe that housing is the largest domestic political problem the United Kingdom faces and that the planning system is the biggest barrier to solving it,” says the company.

The company’s sophisticated planning engine simplifies the complex process of obtaining planning permissions and has the potential to unlock a completely unserved market of smaller land parcels.

- A message from our partner -



Tract’s planning engine is capable of identifying sites with favourable planning characteristics and determining the type of development that can be carried out on a site, along with the necessary documentation.

By digitising and organising extensive local planning data, the software can assess planning risk by analysing past applications and predicting likely outcomes.

According to the company’s claims, its technology has the potential to revolutionise the real estate industry by addressing complex and unpredictable permission processes for smaller land parcels.

Similarly, it could free up land owned by large institutional landowners for productive use. It could also maximise the potential value of the land. A planning permission raises the median value of agricultural land from £20k/ha to £2.4m/ha.

The company’s software helps understand the value of land, and the planning constraints that might affect its viability.

Tract will identify the most viable land, promote it on behalf of landowners, get planning permission for homes, and sell the land to people who want to build houses, taking a percentage of the increase in value.

According to the company, Tract believes there are around 200,000 sites suitable for building in the UK that could benefit from the software.",2024-08-29,https://siliconcanals.com/tract-raises-funding/
Denmark’s Uniqkey bags €5.3M to make cybersecurity user-centric,"Hovedstaden-based Uniqkey, a company that offers password and access management solution, has raised €5.35M in funding to expand its cybersecurity solution across Europe, helping companies become more resilient to cyber-attacks and data theft.

According to a statement from Uniqkey, rising geopolitical tensions and decades of underinvestment in digital infrastructure have left Europe dependent on foreign technology, threatening its digital sovereignty. Uniqkey aims to bolster Europe’s digital independence.

Investors supporting Uniqkey

The round was led by Swedish VC BackingMinds, with contributions from industry veterans including Jesper Zerlang (former CEO of Logpoint), Lars Ankjer, Otto Krabbe, Rolf Bladt, and several notable angels and key employees.

Susanne Najafi, Founding Partner at BackingMinds, says, “At BackingMinds, we invest in what we call blind spots – overlooked areas with great potential. With less than 1 per cent of all founders in Cyber security being immigrants and with only 2 per cent of all Cyber security startups coming from the Nordics, Uniqkey stands out as a hidden gem.”

Sara Wimmercranz, Founding Partner at BackingMinds, adds, “After tracking 500+ cybersecurity startups across Europe, it was clear that Uniqkey stood out. We have been impressed by Hakan, the company’s management team, their technical expertise and are very happy to support them in their mission to protect Europe from the growing cyber threat.”

Aiming to become the go-to security solution

Companies often underestimate the threat of cyber-attacks, which can devastate their operations, especially as digital footprints grow with remote work.

- A message from our partner -



Uniqkey’s military-grade cybersecurity solution addresses this by offering encrypted password protection directly to employees, significantly enhancing security.

By requiring a mobile app for system logins—similar to national ID apps used for banking—Uniqkey ensures high-level encryption and eliminates the need for users to remember passwords, mitigating the risk of data theft and cyber-attacks.

Hakan Yagci, CEO and founder of Uniqkey, says, “Today, everybody’s got a mobile phone. Mobile phones have become an essential way we access our everyday life online. That is exactly why we’ve made the mobile phone central to Uniqkey’s security solution, and a big part of why we’re seeing great demand for our solution.”

“In the same fashion, as mobile apps have changed the way we send money instantly or access our bank accounts, Uniqkey will change the way we access systems internally within the company – easy, fast and secure.”

Uniqkey aims to evolve beyond password protection to become a complete digital security guard for employees, focusing on education and enhancing cyber awareness across organisations.

The company looks to bolster the security of European citizens and companies against cyberattacks.

Capital utilisation

Hakan Yagci, CEO and founder of Uniqkey, says, “Today we protect 500+ SMEs across Europe and we’ve seen great demand for our cyber security solution, having grown 100 per cent YoY over the past two years.”

“We can really feel the pull in the market and want to keep investing in growth and product. With the investment, we invest in continued growth and keep up with the latest safety standards.”

Simon Cederstråhle Hellstrøm-Melander, CMO of Uniqkey, adds, “This new funding will help accelerate the way we scale our technology to thousands of companies across Europe in the coming years. Protecting SMEs is at the heart of what we do and hopefully, we can play an important part in Europe’s rising cyber landscape.”

Brief about Uniqkey

Founded by Danish entrepreneur Hakan Yagci, Uniqkey emerged from the need to balance cybersecurity with usability. Initially developed to secure his previous company, Uniqkey has evolved into a solution addressing major security challenges.

The company now provides a password and access management system, delivering military-grade security with convenience for IT and employees alike.

Yagci launched the company after encountering challenges with cybersecurity solutions in his prior role. Following his departure from OrderYoyo, which was IPO’d in 2021, Yagci founded Uniqkey, built a team, and grew the company to 50 employees.",2024-08-29,https://siliconcanals.com/denmarks-uniqkey-bags-e5-3m/
Estonian renewable energy producer Sunly secures €300M,"Tallinn-based Sunly, a renewable energy producer, announced that it has secured €300M in debt financing to drive the development of 1.3 GW of solar, wind, storage, and hybrid parks in the Baltics and Poland.

Sunly is an independent energy producer focused on developing renewable energy projects in the Baltics and Poland. It also manages a portfolio of renewable energy and electrification startups in Estonia.

The company was founded by the 4Energia team after selling 4Energia to Enefit Green AS, at which point 4Energia was the largest renewable energy company in the Baltics. Currently, Sunly operates with local teams in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland.

Investors supporting Sunly

The funding comes from Rivage Investment via its REDI HR2 fund and Fund for Infrastructure Climate Solutions, Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP) through its Green Credit Fund I, and Norway’s largest pension company, KLP, via CIP-managed funds.

​Gaétane Tracz, Partner and Head of the Infrastructure Debt team at Rivage, says, “We are delighted to support Sunly’s strong leadership team through their ambitious growth trajectory and to help accelerate the construction of hybrid renewable energy parks across the Baltics and Poland.”

“We share Sunly’s mission of contributing to produce power with purpose, to contribute to European Union energy security and to deliver investments with both attractive performance and ESG impact.”

- A message from our partner -



​Jakob Groot, Partner at CIP and Co-Head of the CI Green Credit Fund I, adds, “We are very excited to start our partnership with Sunly, and their highly experienced management team. This financing package will contribute significantly to the development and construction of renewable energy projects, supporting the decarbonisation ambitions across the Baltics and Poland, and represents an attractive investment for our Green Credit Fund I.”

Capital utilisation

​Priit Lepasepp, co-founder and CEO of Sunly, says, “This investment enables us to improve our infrastructure with new grid connections and solar parks in the Baltics, which will support our onshore wind and storage pipeline expansion.”

“To help reduce energy costs, our focus will be on two key areas: building a hybrid pipeline with storage capabilities and advancing the electrification of heating and mobility systems, thereby diminishing our reliance on imported fossil fuels and optimising the use of local renewable resources.”

Sunly plans to develop integrated hybrid parks that combine wind, solar, and energy storage at a single connection point with a direct line to consumers. This approach stabilises energy production in varying weather conditions and reduces grid connectivity charges, which are expected to account for over half of total energy costs.

The strategy aims to enhance regional energy security and operational efficiency, benefiting consumers, especially large industrial clients with high energy consumption.

On a mission to ensure the availability of clean energy

The 244 MW Risti solar park in Estonia is one of the first projects to benefit from Sunly’s financing, capable of powering 55,000 households annually.

Planned as a hybrid park, it may later include wind turbines and battery storage. Construction will also begin on four solar parks in Latvia, totalling 553 MW, with future plans to add wind or battery storage.

The 1.3 GW portfolio further includes large hybrid solar parks in Lithuania and various solar parks in Poland, all to be completed by the end of 2026.

Sunly’s expansion is backed by a total of €765M in debt and equity capital from investors, including Mirova, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and various banks.

In 2023, the company raised €200M from existing investors to further develop solar and wind parks in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland.",2024-08-29,https://siliconcanals.com/renewable-energy-producer-sunly-bags-e300m/

Amsterdam-based SELANA introduces the first legal E-step in the Netherlands: Know more,"Amsterdam-based SELANA, an e-mobility startup, announced on Thursday that it has introduced SELANA Alpha, the upcoming first legally approved E-step in the Netherlands.

SELANA Alpha, developed after five years of R&D, is scheduled for Q4 2024 launch. With this, the Dutch company aims to offer a safe, sustainable, and convenient alternative to cars in cities.

Birth of SELANA Alpha

Founded by Chingiskhan Kazakhstan and Max Schalow, SELANA is at the forefront of E-mobility innovation, producing and selling micromobility vehicles to B2B clients worldwide.

Talking about the motivation behind developing a legal e-scooter in the Netherlands to Silicon Canals, Chingiskhan Kazakhstan, CEO and co-founder of SELANA, says, ” Five years ago the E-scooter boom was happening in the US, and after we bought a couple ourselves, we loved it so much and believed that it’s the future of urban travel that can replace cars and make cities safer and cleaner. So we thought, why not bring them to the Netherlands? However, we found out they were illegal. Thought it might take a year at most, but it wasn’t that easy.”

With the Alpha, SELANA aims to redefine urban transportation, offering a convenient, safe, and sustainable alternative to traditional vehicles.

Challenges

As of today, no throttle E-steps are legally approved under Dutch road safety regulations. Over 200,000 illegal E-steps roam the Dutch streets, and police enforce a €400 fine and take away the illegal E-step.

- A message from our partner -



Explaining the challenges, Kazakhstan adds, “Starting a startup as an international student in a university involves typical hurdles such as learning how to do it, making plans, raising funding during COVID, and dealing with stress. In addition to these challenges, there are numerous regulatory obstacles that a typical deep tech startup must overcome when developing hardware or software products, establishing quality systems, obtaining certifications, becoming a manufacturer, and passing tests. This has been the ongoing reality for the past five years, a time period during which most people would have given up.”

What makes SELANA Alpha special?

SELANA’s e-scooter comes with its legal status and advanced features:

Speed : Maximum 25 km/h, adhering to legal limits

: Maximum 25 km/h, adhering to legal limits Safety Features : Front and rear brakes, turning lights, and 10-inch air tyres

: Front and rear brakes, turning lights, and 10-inch air tyres Smart Technology: NFC keycard unlocking and tracking capabilities

“We, as manufacturers, are listed alongside car manufacturers like Toyota and Tesla, so maintaining top-notch quality control is essential even as a startup. That’s why our product includes extra safety features and certified parts. For instance, due to a regulation change, we had to adjust the position of the front turning lights by a couple of centimetres. Due to this modification we created a completely new design and mold, resulting in significant expenses,” states Kazakhstan.

Priced at €1,900, the Alpha positions itself as an alternative to illegal E-steps and higher-priced competitors like the VanMoof S5 at €3,298.

“We tested it with any age, gender, and background, and with 0 experience, they tried it and loved it right away. This can increase inclusivity on the roads and provide a great convenient alternative to cars. It’s already proven itself in other countries, and the Netherlands with its bike lanes and culture, will be a perfect example to the rest of the world of how the future urban mobility should look like,” he adds.

SELANA is launching an exclusive pre-order campaign with a refundable €100 deposit. Through this pre-order campaign, customers can secure their place on the waitlist for the Alpha.

The Dutch company anticipates strong market reception, projecting sales of 10,000 units in 2025.

Moving forward

In terms of future plans, SELANA aims to expand by growing its partner dealer and service network.

“Introduce a more affordable version for the mass market, similar to Tesla’s strategy. Expand our offerings to meet actual needs, not just another electric car, but possibly something smaller,” he adds.",2024-08-29,https://siliconcanals.com/selana-introduces-first-legal-e-step/
