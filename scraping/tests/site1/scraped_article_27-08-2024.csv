"New Kid on the Block: Here’s how Cino plans to replace Splitwise, Paypal, TIKKIE, and spreadsheets","The ever-evolving digital age has brought numerous conveniences into our lives, and managing finances is no exception. Gone are the days of awkward conversations about who owes what and how much!

Meet Cino an app that addresses a common yet cumbersome task—splitting bills and sharing expenses. Founded in 2021 by Elena Churilova, and Lina Saleh, Cino aims to eliminate the challenge of manual calculations and ensure everyone pays their shares without a touch of awkwardness.

Beyond automation and convenience, Cino is on a mission to bring a sense of fairness and transparency to financial interactions — whether it’s for dining out, travelling, or sharing household expenses.

As a part of our New Kid on the Block series, Silicon Canals recently had the opportunity to interview Elena Churilova, who serves as the CEO and Co-Founder of Cino.

During the interview, Elena provided us with valuable insights into the company’s vision, mission, roadmap, and much more.

Do give it a read!

- A message from our partner -



Inspiration behind Cino

Talking about the inspiration behind founding Cino to Silicon Canals, Elena says, “Lina and I crossed paths in October 2021, and we instantly clicked over a shared goal — making group payments more equitable. I had just started dating my current partner and was frustrated with how outdated and clunky the existing expense-sharing options were. As a product manager, I couldn’t help but think there had to be a better way to share budgets than using IOU apps and joint bank accounts.”

As a result, Lina approached the problem from a different perspective. She recognised that money is often a taboo topic in many cultures and was particularly aware of the gender gap in financial matters.

Women frequently earn less than their partners, leading them to contribute through smaller, regular purchases like groceries instead of big-ticket items like mortgages.

“With these motivations in mind, Lina and I jumped into a nine-month journey of discovery. We talked to university students to get a real sense of what people needed and reached out to every payment provider we could find to explore possibilities. What began as a simple idea quickly evolved into something far more impactful. Our goal was to make a real difference in how people manage money with their partners, friends, and families,” she explains.

Cino’s mission and vision

“Cino exists to make managing shared expenses as easy as paying individually,” explains Elena.

Cino’s mission is to remove the taboos and tension around money by offering a transparent and effortless solution.

“With a focus on Gen Z – who are rewriting the rules of money management – we are empowering this digital-first generation to manage finances on their terms, reducing money anxiety and boosting financial inclusion,” adds Elena.

How does Cino work?

Cino is a group payment app that simplifies splitting bills and sharing expenses among friends, colleagues, and family.

With its instant bill-sharing feature and integration with existing payment methods, Cino aims to make group payments effortless and efficient.

“Imagine tapping your phone to pay a dinner bill, and instead of one person fronting the cost, you’ve instantly paid as a group. Each person’s share is directly deducted from their bank accounts, eliminating the need for shared wallets, payment requests, and expense tracking,” she explains.

Cino removes the constant need to discuss money, calculate bills, and chase people for cash, making group experiences seamless, fair, and stress-free.

Overcoming Unique Challenges

While the concept of simplifying group payments is not entirely new, managing shared payments after the purchase remains a challenge.

According to Elena, existing solutions focused on tracking who owes what but failed to streamline group payments at the moment of purchase. The shift to contactless payments during COVID-19 highlighted this gap.

“Cino addresses this gap with a simple yet innovative approach, entirely flipping the narrative of what shared expenses should look like. Unlike the cumbersome process of fronting money, calculating, and chasing payments, Cino enables seamless group payments at the point of purchase. However, communicating this entirely new experience has posed a challenge—we’re not just another joint account or IOU app; we’re offering something truly unprecedented,” she remarks.

Focusing on Gen Z

Cino app is specifically designed for Gen Z, who frequently share expenses, claims Elena.

Explaining about it, Elena responds, “During my time at Bumble, I delved deep into data on Gen Z and found that financial issues were a major cause of relationship breakups. This generation, shaped by the 2008 financial crisis, COVID-19, inflation, and other global challenges, is highly concerned about its future. They prioritise relationships and memorable experiences over material possessions, likely due to their heightened awareness of climate issues and the uncertain future.”

Consequently, the founding duo conducted extensive interviews with both Gen Z and millennials and found out that Gen Z expected a solution like Cino.

Unlike millennials familiar with older fintech apps, Gen Z often resorted to pen and paper or Excel for managing finances, frustrated by the lack of digital tools tailored to them, claims Elena.

“What unites both Gen Z and millennials is their discomfort with discussing money, often tied to self-worth and societal expectations. Cino alleviates this and ensures fairness, fostering trust and improving financial inclusion,” adds Elena.

In terms of security, Cino complies with EU industry regulations, using advanced encryption and tokenisation to ensure secure user data.

Moving forward!

Cino is currently working on bringing some features, including the ability to split rent and utilities, a simple method for group payments without requiring every participant to have the Cino app and a group payment solution for businesses.

“We have so many upcoming feature requests that it’s hard to pick only a few. Many use cases require us to build new products to tackle the world of group payments, and we are only just getting started,” she adds.

The company is planning to reach over 4 million users, handling $1B in monthly splits by 2028, and to expand its services globally to cater to users in every country.

“We look forward to hearing the phrase “Let’s Cino this” in the lexicon of Gen Zers globally. At the end of the day, money isn’t just about transactions—with Cino, we plan to eliminate taboos, empower individuals, and foster financial inclusion across genders and all types of relationships,” she concludes.",2024-08-27,https://siliconcanals.com/new-kid-on-the-block-cino/
Redalpine announces new €179M fund and new London office,"Zurich-based Redalpine, a Swiss venture capital firm that empowers “GameChangers”, has secured its largest fund to date, the oversubscribed $200M (approximately €179M) Redalpine Capital VII (RAC VII).

According to the Swiss VC firm, this deal marks a milestone in nearly two decades of supporting innovative and disruptive startups.

In addition to the new fund, Redalpine is also expanding its European footprint with the opening of a new office in London, a growing hub for deeptech and AI.

Led by Sebastian Becker, the London base will strengthen Redalpine’s ties with the local tech ecosystem and reinforce its position as a pan-European fund.

What to expect from the new fund?

With RAC VII, Redalpine aims to support the next generation of founders and unlock the economic potential of innovation.

RAC VII is set to support 15 to 20 European early-stage companies, with nine investments already made, including backing the Germany-based nuclear startup Proxima Fusion and UK’s Expression Edits, a gene-editing company developing life-saving therapies.

- A message from our partner -



Reportedly, like its predecessors, RAC VII remains sector-agnostic, targeting innovation across diverse fields such as energy, health, and food.

Redalpine says, “RAC VII will continue our tradition of backing European companies with what we call a “tech hedge”—a significant, defensible advantage that is 10x better than their competitors. We believe that now, more than ever, is the ideal time to invest in these kinds of companies.”

“We are at a pivotal moment in technological development, with transformative changes converging across all industries.”

“AI is reshaping the way we work and live, and as a fund with a long history investing in the continuum of software and science, we are particularly excited about new AI applications, as well as the latest breakthroughs in computer science that will propel the field forward.”

Empowering GameChangers

Founded in 2006, Redalpine empowers ambitious entrepreneurs by combining financial investment, operational expertise, and a vast international network.

With over €1B in assets under management and a sector-agnostic investment approach, Redalpine has supported some of Europe’s most disruptive companies, including N26, Taxfix, and Inkitt.

The firm has a diverse portfolio of over 95 companies, investing across Europe from offices in Zurich and Berlin.

Redalpine focuses on transformative areas such as AI middleware, energy revolution, automation, mobility, health tech, data solutions, new food, and synthetic biology.

Founded by software entrepreneur Peter Niederhauser and molecular biologist Michael Sidler, Redalpine blends scientific and business expertise to guide startups through all stages of their growth. Their disciplined Swiss approach ensures complete support for founders, from inception to exit.

The firm says, “Historically, we have supported close to 50 per cent of our startups through three or more funding rounds, and over 65 per cent of our seed companies advance to a Series A round, far surpassing the European average of just over 20 per cent (according to Dealroom data).”

“To double-down even further, we launched our multi-stage Summit Fund to provide the means to back our portfolio superstars all the way to pre-IPO, reducing reliance on US funding in the later stages.”",2024-08-27,https://siliconcanals.com/redalpine-announces-new-e179m-fund-new-office/

Poland's MMI bags €7.7M to develop electric & hydrogen buses,"Polish bus manufacturer MMI, a producer of small and medium-sized buses, has secured €7.7M from the Vinci SA fund to develop electric buses in three variants including low-entry, low-floor, and normal-floor.

Vinci SA, owned by Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego, funds Polish businesses to help keep new technologies and patents in Poland and promote them worldwide. It manages three funds, HiTech ASI for tech companies, Da Gama ASI for assisting Polish businesses to expand abroad, and IQ ASI for early-stage research projects.

City buses to be zero-emission by 2030

Public transport, particularly buses, plays a crucial role in daily life, offering extensive connectivity. However, diesel buses substantially contribute to environmental pollution, especially in urban areas, leading to poor air quality and smog.

According to data from the European Commission, heavy-duty vehicles, including city buses, are responsible for over 6 per cent of total greenhouse gas emissions in the EU and more than 25 per cent of CO2 emissions in road transport.

To address this, the European Commission set a new target for the EU in February 2024 to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by 90 per cent by 2040, as part of the European Green Deal. A key proposal mandates that all new city buses be zero-emission by 2030.

According to a statement from MMI, despite the growing presence of electric and hybrid city buses, their use is still mostly limited to major routes in large cities. Challenges persist in servicing less crowded night routes, city centres, and transportation in smaller or rural areas, particularly in mountainous regions.

- A message from our partner -



The Polish bus manufacturer MMI, a family-owned company with over 70 employees, is addressing these challenges by transitioning to the production of zero-emission vehicles.

Capital utilisation

The funds will enhance MMI’s zero-emission drive technology, chassis, and body construction, strengthening its market position in Poland and Western Europe.

MMI also plans to develop a hydrogen fuel cell-powered electric minibus and build a modern production hall, aiming to double its vehicle production capacity.

Stanisław Zdrojewski, CEO of MMI, says, “Our goal is to create buses with the lowest possible curb weight to maximise their range. We are developing a new type of body structure using composite technology, specifically a skeletal-laminate construction, which will significantly reduce the weight compared to the traditional steel-aluminum frame.”

“Additionally, we plan to develop a drivetrain system utilising synchronous motors integrated into the wheel hubs of the drive axle. This will simplify the power transmission system, increasing its efficiency and reliability.”

According to Zdrojewski, MMI’s future plans involve developing a hydrogen fuel cell-powered bus and building a modern production hall, which will allow them to double their current production volume.

Recent growth and development

MMI, which experienced a threefold improvement in financial performance last year, exceeding 70 million PLN in revenue, plans to offer a full range of minibuses within three years.

This development will help MMI align with European market needs, strengthen its position in Poland, and expand operations in Italy, France, Germany, Switzerland, and Scandinavia.

Piotr Woliński, CEO of Vinci SA, says, “The company’s development schedule for urban, intercity, and school buses aligns well with market expectations, particularly regarding EU regulations on zero-emission urban transport.”

“MMI’s electric minibuses will be among the few of their kind produced in Europe and one of only two when it comes to minibuses powered by hydrogen fuel cells. The body design project, developed by the company’s R&D team in collaboration with external consultants, represents a European-scale innovation, positioning the company to compete for a strong position in the international market.”

Woliński further adds, “Our investment in the MMI project aligns with the mission and objectives entrusted to Vinci by Bank BGK, which include developing technologies that support sustainable development and technological transformation in our region.”",2024-08-27,https://siliconcanals.com/mmi-secures-e7-7m-for-electric-hydrogen-buses/
