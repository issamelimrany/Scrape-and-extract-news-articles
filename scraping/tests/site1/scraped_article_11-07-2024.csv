GenAI and energy investment propel European VC to $30B,"In H1 2024, European tech investment has propelled to nearly $30B, driven by mega rounds for energy and Generative AI companies, reveals data from Dealroom.

This is up by 12 per cent compared to the same time last year, signalling a strong return to growth for the European tech ecosystem.

Strong quarter for Generative AI and Energy sector

Generative AI had its strongest quarter on record, with $2.6B raised across multiple companies.

Meanwhile, the Energy sector remains the most funded in 2024, with a total of $5.6B raised.

Late-stage investment has seen an 8 per cent year-on-year increase to over $5B in both sectors, says the report.

Additionally, breakout funding (stage B to C) has reached its highest total in six quarters at $6.2B. In the current year, 1450 companies across Europe have raised at least $2B.

- A message from our partner -



AI soaring high

According to the report, AI investments now account for 18 per cent of all funding flowing across Europe, up from 6.9 per cent only 10 years ago.

Generative AI makes up 10 per cent of all European VC funding so far this year, adds the report.

The top five AI investment rounds include:

Wayve – $1.1B Series C

Mistral AI – $503M Series B

DeepL – $300M Late VC

Amsterdam court rules in favour of Temper,"The District Court of Amsterdam has reached a verdict in a case brought forward by trade unions FNV and CNV against Temper, a platform for self-employed individuals, asserting that Temper acts as an employer for the workers on its platform.

After four years of legal proceedings, the court has ruled in favor of Temper, confirming that it is not considered an employment agency.

Temper CEO Maarten Zoomers says, “People consciously choose the freedom and flexibility that working through Temper offers, the possibility to adapt work to their life instead of the other way around. Unlike traditional forms of ‘flex’, which are actually only flexible for employers, our model offers real autonomy and flexibility to workers. We are therefore pleased with the court’s ruling, which confirms that this model has a right to exist.”

FNV & CNV to appeal

This ruling follows an earlier ruling (12 October 2023) in which the Court had already concluded that the unions were no longer allowed to act on behalf of the people who had worked via Temper.

As a result, the Dutch union — FNV & CNV plans to appeal against the verdict.

“An incomprehensible ruling, which conflicts with other case law from recent years in other platform cases. We have no choice but to appeal’, says FNV and CNV.

- A message from our partner -



Zakaria Boufangacha, Vice-chair of FNV says “This judgment of the judge is at odds with all the case law of the past years in all other platform cases. It is also in conflict with the judgment of the labor inspectorate in 2021. And with the advice last week of the Advocate General to the Supreme Court in the Helpling case. It is even in conflict with the upcoming legislation.”

Piet Fortuin, chairman of CNV, adds, “Temper is undermining the foundations of the labour market. It is really time for politicians, the tax authorities, and hirers to put a stop to this. Because these types of constructions are not good for employees and not good for the labour market and society as a whole.”

Boufangacha adds, ‘Recently, the labour inspectorate ruled in its report on YoungOnes that this company is a temporary employment agency. And this company uses exactly the same methods as Temper. That is why it is incomprehensible that the judge rules differently than the labour inspectorate. That is why we are appealing.’

What happened?

In October 2020, Dutch unions FNV & CNV issued a summons against the online platform Temper, which deploys temporary workers in various sectors.

The case aimed to legally establish that Temper should be recognised as the (temporary) employer of the self-employed individuals, also known as FreeFlexers, who utilise the platform for work.

The judgement

“In short, the essential elements of the temporary employment contract, namely the formal authority of the temporary employment agency and the payment of wages by that temporary employment agency, are not met at all. The third essential element, the personal performance of work, has not been fulfilled, if at all,” says the court.

The court also stated that there was insufficient evidence to support the notion of a temporary employment contract between Temper and the workers.

As a result, the court rejected the claims presented by FNV and CNV that these were indeed temporary employment contracts with Temper.

Temper: What you need to know

Temper, founded in 2015, is the first and largest digital noticeboard for “flexible workers” in the Netherlands.

The company was founded in response to the need for greater freedom and flexibility in the labour market—to address the mismatch between labour supply and demand.

The Dutch company enables people to earn flexibly as additional freelance work while studying or starting a business.

Through its platform, flexible workers find companies offering short-term jobs in the hospitality, retail, and logistics sectors.

Temper’s noticeboard has over 100,000+ registered job seekers and 10,000+ companies, most SMEs. The total number of hours worked via the platform is growing at an average rate of 300 per cent per year, claims the company.",2024-07-11,https://siliconcanals.com/amsterdam-court-rules-in-tempers-favour/
Dutch immunotherapy company Pan Cancer T bags €4.2M,"Rotterdam-based Pan Cancer T, a biotech startup specialising in advanced T cell therapies for solid cancer treatment, has closed €4.25M in a seed extension round. This round brings the company’s total raised capital to around €11M.

The funding includes backing from new investor InnovationQuarter Capital and ongoing support from existing investors Van Herk Ventures, Thuja Capital, Swanbridge Capital, and Erasmus MC O&O Holdings.

Kees Recourt, Senior Investment Manager at InnovationQuarter, says, “InnovationQuarter is proud to invest in Pan Cancer T, contributing to the development of state-of-the-art cell therapies to combat hard-to-treat cancers.”

- A message from our partner -



It also supports the advancement of pipeline projects for colorectal and ovarian cancers, alongside the development of a new engineering approach.

Rachel Abbott, CEO of Pan Cancer T, says, “We are delighted to have closed this financing round with the support of InnovationQuarter and our existing investors. This enables us to advance our lead product toward the clinic, offering new hope for patients with triple-negative breast cancer.”

“It also provides a firm foundation to secure a Series A round within the coming year and seek business development partnerships with Biotech and Pharma collaborators to further develop our assets, including our TCR:CO-STIM platform that is applicable to other TCRs and tumour indications.”

Next-gen T cell therapy for solid tumours

Adoptive T cell therapies are effective in treating blood cancers, but they struggle to work well against solid cancers. This is because there aren’t enough specific targets in solid cancers for these therapies to attack, limiting who can benefit from them. Also, the solid tumour environment often stops these therapies from working for very long.

Pan-Cancer T, originating from Prof. Reno Debets’ lab at Erasmus Medical Center, is developing solutions to these challenges.

The company’s lead candidate, PCT1:CO-STIM, uses an IP-protected T cell receptor (TCR) developed with their TCR discovery platform. This TCR targets ROPN1, a specific protein found in over 90 per cent of patients with triple-negative breast cancer and melanoma.

Additionally, it includes a solution for the tumour microenvironment (TME), which boosts T cell activity despite the challenging conditions, resulting in significantly improved response duration in preclinical models.

Brief about Pan Cancer T

Pan Cancer T was founded in 2020 as a spin-off from Erasmus MC in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, with a focus on advancing advanced TCR T cell therapies for challenging solid tumours.

The company’s strategy includes targeting unique targets present in various solid cancers and developing technologies to improve the longevity of T cell therapies.

Pan Cancer T is actively conducting R&D programmes aimed at creating safe and effective adoptive T cell therapies that can benefit a wide range of patients, including those with triple negative breast cancer, bladder cancer, ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, skin cancer, esophageal cancer, lung cancer, and brain cancer.",2024-07-11,https://siliconcanals.com/dutch-based-pan-cancer-t-secures-e4-2m/
