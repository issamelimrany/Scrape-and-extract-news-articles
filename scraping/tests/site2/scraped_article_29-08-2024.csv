Araya closes Super Angel Fund at $10.9M,"London-based Arāya Ventures has announced the $10.6 million first close of the Arāya Super Angel Fund - a community-powered fund which will invest in up to 60 pre-seed and seed stage founders across the next four years in health tech, fintech, climate, commerce and work. Fund investors include Bridgerton actress Charithra Chandran, former Credit Suisse CEO Phil Cutts and former Browns CEO Holli Rogers.

The Arāya Super Angel fund will invest pre-seed and seed cheques of $200k - $550k and will ""give founders access to significant value-add"" from Rupa, the Arāya Ventures team, the Super Angel Fund investors and Arāya’s extensive angel and proprietary scout network.

An exited entrepreneur, Founder & Managing Partner Rupa Popat has closed Arāya Ventures’ first fund with a plan to invest $25m via a community-powered model with the aim to be the ‘most value-add investor’ on the cap table.

The Arāya Super Angel fund will invest pre-seed and seed cheques of $200k - $550k and in addition will give founders access to significant value-add from Rupa, the Arāya Ventures team, the Super Angel Fund investors and Arāya’s extensive angel and proprietary scout network.

The Arāya Super Angel fund benefits from a flexible hybrid structure which accommodates both EIS and non-EIS investments. It will invest capital over a four-year deployment, with 10 to 15 investments per year to increase diversification and maximise on performance, reserving 25% for repeat founders who have already built a business previously.

Some of Rupa’s previous investments include sequel by repeat entrepreneur Alex Macdonald, Jude by Peony Li, Indē Wild by Diipa and Oleg Buller-Khosla and Lapse by Dan and Ben Silvertown which last year closed a $30 million Series A round. 52% of the existing portfolio companies have raised in or scaled into the U.S. market.

The Arāya Super Angel fund is powered by a community of over 80 fund investors including current and exited entrepreneurs such as Media Zoo founder Rachel Pendered, and Cambridge Spark founder & Chairman Dr Raoul-Gabriel Urma, angel and VC investors such as Niraj Pabari of Switzerland-based Giano Capital and former COO and co-founder of Precede Capital Partners Daljit Sandhu, operators, financial professionals from Royal Bank of Canada, Plurimi and Blackrock, C-suite leaders and family offices from a variety of industries. Some of the fund’s investors will also be on hand to support founders with their network and expertise across Data & AI, Go-to-market strategy, Fundraising, Growth, US expansion and more.

Over 15 percent of the fund is made up of family offices, which invest directly at Series A and B; at least 65% are from ethnic minority backgrounds; 60% are current or exited founders and 16% are from outside the UK across the US, Middle East, and India.

In addition to the fund investors, founders will have access to a combined 40+ years’ experience in Rupa and the Arāya team who are committed to providing more value “than a cheque” to their portfolio companies.

Founders will also benefit from Arāya Ventures Academy for Angels (AVA Angels) which will have 250 angel investor graduates by the end of 2024 and over 1,000 by the end of 2025. This is also part of the fund’s proprietary scout network and will offer the angel investors co-investment opportunities into deals backed by the fund.

Rupa Popat said: “This is Arāya Ventures’ first fund and I’m incredibly proud of what we’re able to offer both investors and founders.

“As a former founder turned investor, I’ve been on both sides of the table and I know that for most early-stage founders, whilst capital is important, it’s also about the additional value and support that investors can provide.

“Our approach is incredibly bespoke and personalised and with this unique structure, we’re optimising not only for performance, but plugging a gap to offer real support to early-stage founders and giving them value beyond the cheque.”",2024-08-29,https://tech.eu/2024/08/29/araya-closes-super-angel-fund-at-10-9m/
Naplasol acquires Mycorena to boost the mycelium and alt-protein market,"Naplasol, a member of the VEOS group, has acquired Swedish mycoprotein company Mycorena. With this acquisition, Naplasol will enhance its mycoprotein product portfolio and plans to produce Mycorena’s mycoprotein, Promyc®, at its industrial facility in Bree, Belgium.

In March 2022, Mycorena, which makes a mycelium protein ingredient for meat alternatives, raised €24 million, the largest Series A round on record for an alternative protein company across Europe. This was superseded this year when Infinite Roots raised $58 million.

Mycorena went on to raise €35 million in total funding and, in April this year received funding from the European Space Agency’s (ESA) Discovery Programme in recognition of its products’ potential for use on long-distance space missions.

However, in June, the company announced it was discontinuing its large-scale factory project in Sweden for Promyc, which is in part attributed to its failed attempts to raise Series B funding with SEB and Pareto Securities in 2022-2023.

In July, it filed for bankruptcy. COO and co-founder Ebba Fröling highlighted:

""The past few years have been extremely tough for us. Despite forming valuable partnerships and receiving support from our investors, it was not enough. We hope for the company to get new ownership in order to build on our significant groundwork and that the team, and their efforts, can remain the same.""

Wim Slee, co-CEO of VEOS Group, shared:

“Both companies, Naplasol and Mycorena, are active in the same field and have complementary knowledge and products of which we can benefit in the future. We are proud that we can continue the story of Mycorena, as we strongly believe in the future of mycoproteins.""

""Mycorena has been on an exciting journey toward becoming a leading player in the mycoprotein industry. The acquisition and merger with Naplasol offer a unique opportunity to build on the foundation we have established. We look forward to seeing Mycorena continue to thrive under the strong industrial expertise of the Veos Group,"" says Ramkumar Nair PhD, Founder of Mycorena.

VEOS Group was founded in 1974 and headquartered in Belgium, and operates production facilities worldwide for the food, pet food and feed industries, supported by a global sales network. The acquisition will enable Naplasol to offer a wider range of sustainable solutions for these industries.

Uniqkey Raises €5.35M to strengthen SME cybersecurity in Europe,"Denmark-based Uniqkey has raised €5.35 million to scale its cybersecurity solution across Europe and make companies more resilient to cyber attacks and data theft.

The biggest security risk Europe faces is the low security among its SMEs. 24.3 million SMEs make up 99.8 percent of all companies in Europe and the fact that 12 million SMEs (50 per cent) today don’t have a cyber security plan in place, could paralyse the European economy.

However, serious regulations in the area are just around the corner — NIS2 and DORA — which hold directors and boards personally responsible if the companies they represent don’t have good IT security implemented.

Just as GDPR changed the way companies process data, so NIS2 will change the way companies approach IT security.

Today, companies underestimate the risk of cyber-attacks that can effectively wipe out their existence. Employees leave larger data traces than ever before - due to increased digitisation and due to modern working methods such as ""work from anywhere"".

This makes companies vulnerable to cyber attacks and data theft. Uniqkey, with its military-grade cybersecurity solution, moves encrypted password protection to the individual employees, which strengthens every company against cyber attacks and data theft.

81 per cent of data theft and cyber attacks are due to poor or careless handling of passwords. This is why employees are often the main target for hackers. Uniqkey's solution requires a mobile app when logging into the company's systems — like we have local ID apps across Europe when using our bank accounts (Denmark: MitID, Sweden: BankID etc). It's easy and fast.

All passwords are encrypted to the highest standard and practically impossible to break — and users no longer have to remember their passwords.

According to Hakan Yagci, CEO and founder of Uniqkey:

“Today, everybody’s got a mobile phone. Mobile phones have become an essential way we access our everyday life online. That is exactly why we’ve made the mobile phone central to Uniqkey's security solution, and a big part of why we’re seeing great demand for our solution. In the same fashion as mobile apps have changed the way we send money instantly or access our bank accounts, Uniqkey will change the way we access systems internally within the company - easy, fast and secure. Today we protect 500+ SMEs across Europe and we’ve seen great demand for our cybersecurity solution, having grown 100 per cent YoY over the past two years. With this investment, we invest in continued growth and keep up with the latest safety standards.”

The investment was raised from BackingMinds, in combination with industry veterans such as Jesper Zerlang (ex-CEO of Logpoint), Lars Ankjer, Otto Krabbe, Rolf Bladt, and several well-known angels and key employees.

According to Susanne Najafi, Founding Partner at BackingMinds:

“At BackingMinds, we invest in what we call blind spots - overlooked areas with great potential. With less than 1 per cent of all founders in cybersecurity being immigrants and with only 2 per cent of all cybersecurity startups coming from the Nordics, Uniqkey stands out as a hidden gem.""

AppleVis finds new home with Be My Eyes: a win for blind and low vision tech users,"Be My Eyes, the Danish-founded app for blind and low-vision people is acquiring AppleVis, the go-to online blindness website for accessibility advice on Apple and other technologies.

With a worldwide community of nearly 700,000 users, and 7.5 million volunteers, Be My Eyes connects blind and low-vision users with sighted volunteers and companies, through live video and AI to tackle the inaccessible parts of everyday life, whether at home or at work; all for free to the end user.

The future of AppleVis, a much-loved online community with its active and engaged user base and vast resource of podcasts, forums, and reviews, looked bleak when its founder, David Goodwin, announced in July that it would need to close permanently at the end of August 2024.

While Apple as a company has demonstrated a strong commitment to supporting users with visual impairments through various accessibility features and initiatives, AppleVis was run entirely on a voluntary and unpaid basis — surely given Apple's financial resources and commitment to accessibility, it could have provided paid staff to support this crucial initiative?

But following a fervent chorus of community wishes and support, Be My Eyes will ensure the website’s long-term stability and growth.

“David Goodwin built something remarkable and immensely valuable, and when the Be My Eyes team discussed the possible closure, we quickly concluded that we had to do something to keep such an important and loved community resource available,” said Mike Buckley, CEO of Be My Eyes.

“From the first call with the AppleVis team, we not only learned that we shared the same values and mission, but that we also had similar ideas for how to grow AppleVis and make it even more useful in the future. As always, we will listen and learn first, and then continue to build AppleVis with the direct input and leadership of the blind and low-vision community.”

Under the terms of the acquisition, Be My Eyes will acquire the website and brand, and a licence to all content.

Be My Eyes has also agreed to ensure complete editorial independence for the AppleVis team and contributors going forward. It will also add two paid staff positions and retain key AppleVis volunteers under the new structure to ensure continuity and maintain its institutional knowledge.

To retain the editorial authenticity for the blind and low vision community, the new AppleVis organisation will report directly to Bryan Bashin, Vice Chairman of Be My Eyes.

Bashin, himself blind, has been a former science journalist, Commissioner for the US AbilityONE Commission, and former CEO of the San Francisco Lighthouse for the Blind.

AppleVis like all be My Eyes user features will continue to be free of charge for all of its users.

The acquisition means the site will be restored to full functionality on September 9th or before, in time for analysis of Apple’s autumn software releases. By then, all the traditional AppleVis content relevant to such upcoming releases as iOS 18 and macOS Sequoia, including articles detailing what’s new for blind and DeafBlind users, podcast episodes, and blog posts detailing new and resolved VoiceOver bugs in the respective updates, will be there as usual.

“Fourteen years ago, I along with several others set out to make AppleVis the go to online resource for individuals who are blind or have low vision who wanted to learn more about accessible technologies, "" said David Goodwin, founder of AppleVis.",2024-08-29,https://tech.eu/2024/08/29/applevis-finds-new-home-with-be-my-eyes-a-win-for-blind-and-low-vision-tech-users/
Sunly secures €300M to transition to energy independence in the Baltics,"Estonian enewable energy producer Sunly has raised €300 million in debt financing to accelerate the construction of 1.3 GW of solar, wind, storage, and hybrid parks across the Baltics and Poland. This brings the company’s debt and equity capital from investors to €765 million.

As the EU actively works on reducing its dependence on Russian gas, it faces ongoing challenges.

In the Baltic states and Poland, Russia's significant influence in the regional energy market has historically exposed these areas to price fluctuations and supply disruptions associated with geopolitical tensions, often leading to higher energy costs for consumers than in other European nations. The upcoming desynchronisation from the Russian and Belarusian electricity grid in February next year aims to boost regional energy independence and security.

Sunly intends to develop integrated hybrid parks that combine wind, solar, and energy storage batteries at a single connection point and direct line to consumers.

This method improves energy production stability in various weather conditions and optimises cost-efficiency by reducing grid connectivity charges—forecasted to account for more than half of the total energy cost. The approach is expected to significantly benefit consumers, particularly large industrial clients with high energy consumption, by enhancing regional energy security and operational efficiency.

​Priit Lepasepp, co-founder and CEO of Sunly, said:

“This investment enables us to improve our infrastructure with new grid connections and solar parks in the Baltics, supporting our onshore wind and storage pipeline expansion. To help reduce energy costs, we will focus on two key areas: building a hybrid pipeline with storage capabilities and advancing the electrification of heating and mobility systems, thereby diminishing our reliance on imported fossil fuels and optimising the use of local renewable resources”.

This financing is provided by Rivage Investment via REDI HR2, its second high-yield infrastructure debt fund and its Fund for Infrastructure Climate Solutions, and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP) through its Green Credit Fund I, with additional participation from Norwegian largest pension company Kommunal Landspensjonskasse (KLP) through funds managed by CIP.

​Gaétane Tracz, Partner and Head of the Infrastructure Debt team at Rivage, said:

“We are delighted to support Sunly’s strong leadership team through their ambitious growth trajectory and to help accelerate the construction of hybrid renewable energy parks across the Baltics and Poland.”

​Jakob Groot, Partner at CIP and Co-Head of the CI Green Credit Fund I, said:

“This financing package will contribute significantly to the development and construction of renewable energy projects, supporting the decarbonisation ambitions across the Baltics and Poland, and represents an attractive investment for our Green Credit Fund I”.

One of the first projects to benefit from this financing is the 244 MW Risti solar park in Estonia, which can cover the annual electricity consumption of 55,000 households. Currently intended as a hybrid park, Sunly already has expansion plans that include onshore wind turbines and battery storage in the future.

Construction will also immediately start on four solar parks in Latvia, with a combined capacity of 553 MW. These Latvian parks are also designed as hybrids, with eventual plans to integrate wind or battery storage or a combination of both. The 1.3 GW portfolio also includes several large hybrid solar parks in Lithuania, as well as both small and large solar parks in Poland by the end of 2026.",2024-08-29,https://tech.eu/2024/08/29/sunly-secures-300m-to-transition-to-energy-independence-in-the-baltics/
